<p>This post will take a look at the box score in Visualization form. The goal of this post is to quickly view who scored and assisted on goals from the game.</p>
<p>Buffalo Sabres: 3 (Win)</p>
<p>Once again, the top line strikes, with both Jack Eichel and Sam Reinhart provding to assists on the night and Jeff Skinner scoring another goal.</p>
