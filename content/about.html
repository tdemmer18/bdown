<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr />
<p>This website was created using <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a>. The posts will center around coding and learning to program with the R language. As such, most of my posts will include code chuncks to show off some of the coding I have done to produce the charts/visualizations. All the code for this website is hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/tdemmer18">Github</a> account. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I am always happy to help!</p>

<h3>Family</h3>
<p>The second child of four boys to Jim and MaryBeth Demmer, the best parents I could have asked for. Growing up with three brothers was awesome. We didnâ€™t always get along as kids, but having these guys to turn to means so much to me.</p>
