Who am I?  That is such a good question and one I am still working on to this very day.

For starters, I love my family and love, love, love where I came from.  I am a **WNY'er** at heart and always will be.  I take extreme pride in calling myself a WNY'er.  I get upset when people make fun of my hometown and my sports teams.

So who am I?  Here is a quick glimpse:

The second of four boys to the best parents one could ask for.  Husband to the love of my life, my high-school sweetheart **Amanda**, who continues to inspire and motivate me each and every day.  Father to the most amazing boy **Owen**, who makes me love and laugh more than I ever thought was possible.

Enjoy watching professional sports.  Fantasy sports enthusiast.  Studied to be an accountant (CPA) and currently working for Virginia Tech as a Senior Auditor. Found a new passion for learning to code and trying to soak up every piece of information.
