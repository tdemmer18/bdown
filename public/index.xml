      <description>The National Football League (NFL) just completed it’s 53 season and only three Quarterbacks have thrown for more than 50 touchdown passes during the course of one season. Both Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are considered to be two of the greatest QB’s of all time, the third, Patrict Mahomes was in just his second season, his first as a starter for the Kansas City Chiefs. Follow along below as I use the programming lanugage R to graph and annimate the touchdowns thrown as they accumulate over the season.</description>

      <description>About Me This website was created using Blogdown. The posts will center around coding and learning to program with the R language. As such, most of my posts will include code chuncks to show off some of the coding I have done to produce the charts/visualizations. All the code for this website is hosted on my Github account. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.</description>
